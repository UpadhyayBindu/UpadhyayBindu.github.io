                        <p>DO Change is an EU funded project. They required a dashboard for the cardiac rehab team to get a quick glimpse of patient history from wearable devices.</p>
                        <h3>Gathering requirements</h3>
                        <p>During the duration of the project, we did not have access to doctors. Thus we employed a novel approach to gather requirements by studying the current process that doctors and nurses use to gather patient history. Through this
                            exercise, and by speaking to a cardiologist remotely, we gathered the most important metrics that need to be displayed. </p>

                        <h3>Ideation </h3>
                        <p>I facilitated the Google Design Sprint so that we could narrow down the focus of the project. This also helped us to quickly arrive at a stage where we had three concepts ready to be prototyped. </p>
                        <h3>Prototyping and User Testing</h3>
                        <p>We chose Axure RP and d3.js to make an interactive prototype. We built a dashboard which was customizable depending on the end user (doctor, nurse or rehab specialists). We also tested our prototype with two doctors and also our
                            stakeholders who were responsible for the implementation. </p>
                        <h3>Outcome </h3>
                        <p>We presented the dashboard to the stakeholders. They were very impressed with the progress that we made in such a short duration. They liked the way doctors could interact with it quickly to view the relevant patient parameters.
                            This is under development for the clinical trial. </p>
