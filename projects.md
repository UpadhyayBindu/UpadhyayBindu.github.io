#Projects

Below are some of the projects I have done at the Department of Industrial Design, Eindhoven University of Technology. I am a postgraduate design trainee in the User System Interaction Programme.  Some more information about the USI programme can be found here.

User Onboarding for Eventix

We designed the user onboarding for Eventix. Eventix enables you to setup and manage a ticket shop for your event. More about our design process here.

Dashboard for Cardiologists

We conceptualised and designed a dashboard for the cardiac rehab team, mainly cardiologists and nurses for Do Change, an EU-funded project. The primary goal of the Do CHANGE project is to develop a health ecosystem for integrated disease management for hypertensive and cardiac patients. More about our design process here.
