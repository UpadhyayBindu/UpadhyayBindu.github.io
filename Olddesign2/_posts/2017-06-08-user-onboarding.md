## Gathering requirements

After researching about onboarding, we realized that it is not about applying a layer of tips and tools on the existing product, but has to blend in with the design. First, we performed a heuristic evaluation of the current website and product. On interviewing the CEO of eventix, we found out that their main goal was to convert visitors to loyal users. We also interviewed event organisers to understand their needs. This process enabled us to form an extensive list of requirements with priority. We also came up with three main metaphors of what is Onboarding and what it is not.

## Ideation

After several rounds of brainstorming, we arrived at a concept which involved the redesign of the website, keeping in mind, the onboarding principles.

We took the following approach to ideate:
1. Frame main questions:
After framing four main questions, we wrote these on sheets of paper and circulated them amongst the four of us. Two loops. This led to a lot of ideas and also, collaboration and building on others ideas.
2. Ideate around principles of persuasion:
For every persuasive principle, we came up with ~ten ideas that could be implemented in the design.
3. Personas:
Based on the interviews with event organisers, we created personas.

## Wireframe

We made the wireframes using Balsamiq. This enabled us to prepare the structure of the website and segregate the design into various modules. We then made the modules and prepared ourselves for the user test.

## User testing

Once the modules were ready, we recruited users who have used event management websites. We asked them to build their own site by using these modules. While doing so, we asked them to think aloud. This process was very insightful to know what goes on in the mind of a user when they see a website.

## Outcome

After the user testing, we eliminated some modules. We also made a final design of the website based on our requirements list. One of the deliverables was also a short summary on what is Onboarding so that the team at Eventix could use it in the future. We proposed other design guidelines which did not fall in the scope of our design.
