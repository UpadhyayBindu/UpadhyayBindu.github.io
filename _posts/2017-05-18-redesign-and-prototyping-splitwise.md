## Brief
Redesign and Prototyping of the mobile application, Splitwise.

## Team
Leon Neve, Bindu Upadhyay

## Learning goals
1. Application of iOS Human Interface Guidelines
2. Using axure for making an interactive prototype

## What is Splitwise?
“Splitwise” is a mobile application for sharing bills and keeping track of what you owe others and what others owe to you.

## Why Splitwise?
Splitwise is a well known application with over 1 million installs on android and an overall rating of 4.6. I have been using the app for quite some time now.

The heuristic evaluation showed many flaws in the design. The android and the iOS versions of the app differed to a good extent. The android version seemed easier to use.

## Process

The first step was to find issues in the current application. My teammate hadn't used the app before and he was a good candidate to test the current application. After that, we redesigned, made a prototype and performed user testing. We iterated based on this feedback. We also tested two other platforms to make interactive prototypes.

### Heuristic Evaluation
We did a heuristic evaluation of the iOS version of Splitwise.
Here is how the main screen looks:

These are some issues we found:
* Cluttered
* Unreadable text
* Little negative space
* Unclear buttons & tabs
* Unclear navigation
* No default entries

We performed the evaluation for all the screens and for some simple user flows such as adding a bill, setting a bill and changing the amount in a bill.

After we identified the issues, we did the first redesign.

### Redesign
We referred to iOS Human Interface Guidelines to make a redesign as that was a part of the learning goal for this project. We mainly focused on the user flow for the purpose of redesign. We also tried to make it more visual and less texty.

This is how our home screen looked after redesign:

Some features in the new design to address the issues found in the heuristic evaluation:

* Visuals
* Less buttons
* More negative space
* Slide-out menu
* addition of a “back-button”
* Less screens

Other screens to compare the original and the redesign:

### Interactive Prototyping
The next phase was to make an interactive prototype. For this, we used axure. It was a new tool for both of us. The process of learning and implementing the screens was really fun and helped us make some more changes in our design.

The focus during this part of the design phase was to test out a new way to split bills. We wanted to try and implement swipe interactions. After making the prototype interactive, we tested it with 3 people. They found it quite easy and intuitive to use. However, we received feedback about some elements on other screens. We iterated and made some changes.

We also evaluated two other prototyping platforms:
proto.io and uxpin. The learning curve was easier compared to axure, but the functionalities were limited. For a quick prototype, I would recommend you to try unpin as adding interactions was quite easy. It also had a lot of built in templates and icons.
But to make a highly functional prototype, I would definitely use axure.

Dimensions are set for iPhone 7.

## Learnings
1. Axure is a great tool to prototype interactions.
2. I need to focus on developing skill rather than finding smart ways.
3. Be experimental, especially when there is no external constraint or business requirement for the project
4. Always define learning goals before the project starts.
