	<h1>Hi there, I'm Bindu!</h1>
	<p>I am a UX Designer at Eindhoven University of Technology. Before coming here, I was involved in product based roles. 
	I graduated from Indian Institute of Technology (IITM) with bachelor's and master's in Engineering Design.
	I love running, cycling, hiking, and lifting a barbell. I also like painting, traveling as they help me explore!
